This is just a basic Python script to pull out data from your installation of "Piwik".
This was made so that you can quickly check stats without having to use the full
blown web-based interface. It makes calls based on the API. This was really made
to cement what I've been learning in Python, but I'd like to eventually and gradually
improve on it, and any other suggestions that can be offered to make it smoother/better syntax
or any other general improvements, please let me know :)
